# ecoSphere

## Project Overview

**ecoSphere** is a blockchain-based platform designed to track and reward sustainable actions using NFTs and blockchain, promoting eco-friendly practices with a transparent, decentralized system. Users can register, submit proof of their eco-friendly actions, and have these actions verified using real-time data from IoT devices and blockchain oracles. Verified actions result in NFTs that represent users' contributions, which can be traded, sold, or used within the ecoSphere ecosystem. This platform creates a seamless journey from action to verification to reward, fostering a community focused on sustainability.
  
## Technical Stack  
  
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed using Solidity, these contracts manage NFT issuance, identity management, data verification, and marketplace operations.  
- **Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)**: Used for attesting eco-friendly actions on-chain.  
- **Pyth Oracles**: Integrated for real-time environmental data verification.  
- **Web3.js**: Facilitates interaction between the front-end and the Ethereum blockchain.  
- **Truffle**: A development framework for deploying and managing smart contracts.  
  
## Current State  
  
This project is a work-in-progress and was primarily a learning experience. While the architecture and codebase are in place, the platform is not yet fully functional. The main goal was to establish a foundation for ecoSphere and to explore the integration of various blockchain technologies.  
  
## Planned Features  
  
- **NFT Issuance**: Minting NFTs as a reward for verified eco-friendly actions.  
- **Identity Management**: Decentralized identity for users to manage and verify their actions.  
- **Data Verification**: Using Pyth Oracles to ensure that submitted data is accurate and trustworthy.  
- **Marketplace**: A platform for trading and selling NFTs within the ecoSphere ecosystem.  
- **Governance**: Allowing users to vote on platform decisions through a decentralized voting system.
